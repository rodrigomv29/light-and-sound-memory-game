# light-and-sound-memory-game
1. No outside resources
2. I had a timing challenge where I didn't feel like I had enough time to add any features to my game and I had to make a compromise so that I could finish on time. Learning about the AudioContext class in JavaScript was very difficult because I never used any audio related classes in my experience as a coder. I used the chrome inspect tool so that I could play around with the AudioContext class so that I could gain a further understanding.
3. My biggest question is how does a developer design a web form so that the developer saves information from its users. I believe that one can use phpmyadmin to interact with SQL but I don't know the full details. I am also iterested in what comprises a full stack of technologies. I have tried to understand what the word stack means in terms of web development but I can't seem to put it in my own words.
4. If I had more time I would work on more animations so that the buttons would have a bouncing animation every time the mouse clicked. I would also play around with the gradient colors that have the resemblance of a rainbow using the four buttons. I would have also implemented a clock to keep time of how long each game is.

# Hello Website (blank)

This is a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen 🪄 immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
