1. No outside resources
2. I had a timing challenge where I didn't feel like I had enough time to add any features to my game and I had to make a compromise so that I could finish on time. Learning about the AudioContext class in JavaScript was very difficult because I never used any audio related classes in my experience as a coder. I used the chrome inspect tool so that I could play around with the AudioContext class so that I could gain a further understanding.
3. My biggest question is how does a developer design a web form so that the developer saves information from its users. I believe that one can use phpmyadmin to interact with SQL but I don't know the full details. I am also iterested in what comprises a full stack of technologies. I have tried to understand what the word stack means in terms of web development but I can't seem to put it in my own words.
4. If I had more time I would work on more animations so that the buttons would have a bouncing animation every time the mouse clicked. I would also play around with the gradient colors that have the resemblance of a rainbow using the four buttons. I would have also implemented a clock to keep time of how long each game is.
