## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ *] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ *] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button

* [ *] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ *] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No outside resources

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I had a timing challenge where I didn't feel like I had enough time to add any features to my game and I had to make a compromise so that I could finish on time. Learning about the AudioContext class in JavaScript was very difficult because I never used any audio related classes in my experience as a coder. I used the chrome inspect tool so that I could play around with the AudioContext class so that I could gain a further understanding.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
My biggest question is how does a developer design a web form so that the developer saves information from its users. I believe that one can use phpmyadmin to interact with SQL but I don't know the full details. I am also iterested in what comprises a full stack of technologies. I have tried to understand what the word stack means in terms of web development but I can't seem to put it in my own words.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time I would work on more animations so that the buttons would have a bouncing animation every time the mouse clicked. I would also play around with the gradient colors that have the resemblance of a rainbow using the four buttons. I would have also implemented a clock to keep time of how long each game is and make the game progressively more difficult.
